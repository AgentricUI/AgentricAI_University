AgentricAI University  
Empowering Minds. Engineering Futures. Built for the Ones Who Matter Most.

Overview  
AgentricAI University is the culmination of years of principled engineering, resilient scripting, and emotionally intelligent design. This repository is more than code. It’s a living framework for agentic learning environments, built to empower diverse learners through adaptive, autonomous, and intuitive AI systems.

Crafted by Brandon A. Myers, founder of AgentricAI, this project represents a deeply personal mission: to create the technology his children—and all children—deserve. A space where curiosity is honored, intelligence is nurtured, and every interaction is designed to uplift.

Mission  
“I built this for my kids. For every learner who’s been overlooked. For every dreamer who needs a system that sees them.”

AgentricAI University is a modular, open-source platform for:
- Agentic education workflows that adapt to learner needs
- Ethical AI orchestration with built-in safety and transparency
- Immersive UI/UX environments that feel alive, intuitive, and emotionally resonant
- Invisible automation that supports, not replaces, human agency
